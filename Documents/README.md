# Task2 Project

Welcome to the "Task2 Project", a utility-based Python application designed to make your tasks more efficient. This project includes three key components:

1. **File Organizer** - Organize files in a specified directory based on their types.
2. **Calculator (GUI)** - A graphical calculator that allows for interactive mathematical calculations.
3. **Calculator (Console)** - A simple, user-friendly console calculator for quick arithmetic operations.

 Features

 1. File Organizer:
The File Organizer helps you quickly sort and organize files in a given directory. It categorizes files based on their types and moves them to corresponding folders, which improves organization and saves time.

Key Features:

- Automatically organizes files into categories based on their file extensions (e.g., images, documents, audio, etc.).
- User-friendly interface through the console, allowing easy navigation and use.

1. Calculator (GUI):
The GUI calculator provides a graphical interface for users to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It uses the Tkinter library to create a user-friendly environment.
Key Features:

- Interactive GUI with buttons for basic calculations.
- Clear and simple layout for easy use by beginners.

1. **Calculator (Console)**
This console-based calculator allows users to perform mathematical calculations directly from the terminal. It's lightweight and perfect for quick calculations without opening any graphical interface.
Key Features:

- Supports basic arithmetic operations.
- No need for an internet connection or installation of extra libraries.
